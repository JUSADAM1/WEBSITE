					Its great because you have Air land and sea units. I dont know how to explain it, the whole game is based on a massive scale type of RTS, where one is using hundreds of units playing on multiple fronts.
					One can be fighting against one fraction in the sea while fighting another another faction that is coming at you by land with heavy tanks and air units. I believe that their will not be a game such as 
					Supreme Commander just because of the large scale of things and the quality of how great it truly is.`;

					document.getElementById("starcraft").innerHTML =`Some people may disapprove but I love Starcraft two over one. I played STarcraft one but for some reason I was not good at all, but when I played two I was alot better.
					I dont know what it was but, I just know I was alot better. Anyways Starcraft is awesome overall because one can play as three totally different races that are not similar at all to eachother.
					Their are three fraction that are in the game; their are Terran who are the human beings out of the game who are the least techncally advanced races but still gives the other races a run for their money. The best part about playing as the terran races is
					that one is able to build anywhere on the battlefield. The one thing that does make the terran a force not to be reckoned with is that it holds the games most devastating weapons, the tactical nuke. The Protoss who is a technologically advanced alien races whos society is built around 
					philosphies and stuff like that.I would have to say The Protoss is a great race to play as because they are a pound for pound type of race. The Protoss has the most durable units in the game, but the draw back is that it is costly on your economy. Yea!! all that power comes at a price, so how good are you with money.
				    . But they both have a common enemy  the Zerg, who is technacally are parasite type race, similar to the flood in halo but playable.
					 The Zerg is a race I did not really understand gameplay wise, like playing the race as a player. Based on playing numorous match against people their strength is in numbers. The Zerg, when left unchecked, the Zerg can multiply at a scary rate and spawn large armies fast. The Zerg is only built for 
					 large arnies, meaning you can have one Zergling going against Protoss unit, doesnt work.`;

					document.getElementById("Halowars").innerHTML = `I LOVE HALO!!! I have a xbox because of and other games but mostly Halo. When I heard they where coming out with a Halo RTS game, I automatically knew it was going to be awesome. The first Halo Wars game was a great I loved it charised it, Then they came out with Halo Wars 2, I flipped out and had Seizure.
						I instantly bought it I still play it til this day. Unlike The first first game it only had a small amount of races with to play as now they have alot. Their are so many types of character you can play as its not even funny. I love the fact that they came out with this Halo card game that is built within the games; kinda like gwent in Witcher but with actual moving playing card going agianst each other.
						After playing the game for so long I kinda got tierd playing PVP and wanted something more team based, besides 3V3. So this last update they just drop, introduced a new game mode called Terminus Firefight, where you technacally try to hold protect the terminus from waves and waves of different enemys from all fractions and unit types.`;

					document.getElementById("sid").innerHTML= `Sid Meier Civilization is one of my favorite turn based game.The player takes on the role of the ruler of a civilization, starting with only one settler unit and one warrior, and attempts to build an empire in competition with one to eleven other civilizations. 
					The game requires a fair amount of micromanagement (although less than any of the simulation games). Along with the larger tasks of exploration, warfare and diplomacy, the player has to make decisions about where to build new cities, which improvements or units to build in each city, which advances in knowledge should be sought (and at what rate), and how to transform the land surrounding the cities for maximum benefit. 
					From time to time the player's towns may be harassed by barbarians, units with no specific nationality and no named leader. 
					These threats only come from unclaimed land or sea, so that over time there are fewer and fewer places from which barbarians will emanate. Overall Its a dope game you should play like the rest of the games on this list.`;

					document.getElementById("AoE").innerHTML= `Alot of people may say that Total war is better than Age of Empire, I THINK NOT!!! Anyways  Age of Empires III offers gamers the next level of realism, with advanced battle physics and unparalleled visual detail. 
						The new game picks up where Age of "Empires II: Age of Kings" left off, placing gamers in the position of a European power determined to explore, colonize and conquer the New World. 
						This time period features stunning scenes, from towering European cathedrals to courageous tribes of Native Americans, and spectacular combat with Industrial Age units like rifled infantry, cavalry and tall ships bristling with cannons. Age of Empires III excites strategy gamers with new game-play elements, including the concept of a "Home City," new civilizations, units, technologies and an immersive new single-player campaign that will span three generations.
						To be honest A game like Age of Empire is a one of a kind games.`;

					document.getElementById("comancon").innerHTML= `I love Command and Conquer but I do have my favorites. Without a doubt, the Tiberium universe  has the best story due to its character, really to be honest everything.
						Next I would say arguably Red Alert 2 is awesome because you get a combo of air, land, and sea units. If one would like some upgraded graphics when playing Red Alert I would say Red Alert 3 with the Uprising expansion I like Red Alert 3 because it has much more of a realistic scale,
						much more dynamic, graphics and goofy unit quotes. Interms of the Tiberium Wars series you have to have the Kanes Wrath expansion. Plus the last game they made was horrible; it strained away what was awesome about the series which was the bases building and gathering resources. For all alot of us gamers that are familiar with C&C 4, it never existed.
						Meaning DO NOT PLAY C&C 4, saving you money and time.`;

					document.getElementById("Xco").innerHTML= `XCOM is awesome, I have lost virtual men bravely to their digital deaths, in many games like Command and Conquer, Company of Heroes, Civilization and Starcraft. Dude let me tell you, your going to send your troops into battle and direct them the best you can,but when they die they die for good and you will really really feel it.
						I say that because, you have a team of soldiers, that have special skills that you assign them. The more you use them they level up and get perks, weapon attachments and other stuff. Lets say one gets injured in the mission before and you move on to the next that soldier will still be injured. Plus lets say that soldier dies, its gone forever, weapon and skills and all gone.
						I love the fact that one can assign skills to a specific soldier, like being a sharpshooter, Heavy and light ground troops. Its great because it it is turnbased and makes you think tactically, in terms of owning your own squad and stuff like that. The games has a wonderful environments, and everything is just about customizable. Its a great game to play it is on multiple platforms Xbox,PS and PC.`;

					document.getElementById("Comhero").innerHTML= `OH MY GOD!!! Company of Heroes Franchise is one of the most popular RTS game ever since the second game was released in July of 2013, it has proven to be the best. The game is just amazing, especially when it comes down to the environmental elements.
						When in the snowy lands of Russia your troops are going to need to stay warm so, guess what you have to build a fire or find one, if not your troops will die. I love the Fact that it is in World War II because it was such a big historical war will many types of units. The gameplay is amazing,units ducking for cover, tanks needing enigeers to fix the damage, taking key points of the battlefield to get 
						resources to fuel you economy for weapons ammo, tanks and everything. I can go on and on about Company of Heroes, just take my word for it buy it you wont be disappointed, believe me, its worth the buy.`;
