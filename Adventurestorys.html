						I love fact that what decisions you make carry on to the nexted game. Whatever decision you made in one can comeback and bite you in the butt in game three. They did come put with a fourth game but was not part of the orginal story line. They wanted to start fresh
						with a brand new story, but ended up being a complete disaster, I believe if it had more development time and some add-ons the game would be great.
						Another reason why I love Mass Effect is because it is Huge!!!! different types of aliens from all across the galaxy, planets that have strange aliens creatures and beautiful environment. I would be awesome if they made more games like this game right here.`;

					I love the fact that the players last name is Nora is because that is my last name LOL.
					 The player assumes control of a character referred to as the , who emerges from a long-term cryogenic stasis in Vault 111, an underground nuclear fallout shelter. After witnessing the murder of their spouse and kidnapping of their son, the Sole Survivor ventures out into the Commonwealth to search for their missing child. 
					 The player explores the game's dilapidated world, complete various quests, help out factions, and acquire experience points to level up and increase the abilities of their character. 
					New features to the series include the ability to develop and manage settlements, and an extensive crafting system where materials scavenged from the environment can be used to craft drugs and explosives, upgrade weapons and armor, and construct, furnish and improve settlements.
					I love the fact that one can also use mods freely. The great thing is one doesnt have to go through Nexus mod and other place if they want but Bethesda end up incorporating its on mod system.`;

				Players control Marcus Holloway, a hacker who works with the hacking group DedSec to take down the city's advanced surveillance system known as ctOS. There are multiple ways to complete missions, and each successful assignment increases the follower count of DedSec.
				I love that It takes place in the Bay Area, where I was born and Raised. I love the take on the story side of the game. Hacker group want to stop a sinister surveillance company. `;
