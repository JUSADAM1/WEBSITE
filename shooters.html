					This games amazing. Doom is so dope they made made a movie on it, with the Rock. The concept of  doom is amazing, because it gives off that science fiction and horror style. The concept is awesome, I am a space marine fighting 
					a invasion from Hell, killing demonic creatures, how FREAKIN AWESOME IS THAT!!!. I have been playing Doom since I was child; I loved it because I got to shoot demonic monsters and be challenged at the same time trying to find keys.
					Doom was great it had alot of hidden thing within each level such as doors. I used to go around the whole map trying to find buttons that open hidden walls and areas on the map. I also used to go around the map clicking on walls try to find thoses places.
					To has came a long awy from what it was especially what is to come on the next game.`;

				so far, Far Cry has given gamers a large variety of different environments and have been progressively adding new things into each games. It is crazy the game producers have given us gamers environments such as Tropical islands, High snowy mountain ranges and American country sittings.
				They tried to be different and try to change it with this game called Far Cry Primal which was something that came out of nowhere.To Me, Far Cry Primal never existed, When I saw and played Primal, I was like why!! this is something totally different from Regular Far Cry games. 
				To me it was like Far Cry took a wrong turn and made some sort of Prehistoric times FPS game!?!?!  But then they bounce back with Far Cry 5 for the win which I would have to say is that it is the best out of the Far Cry series. But every games franchise has its faults like people.`;

					I play battlefield for its amazing online gameplay. I loved the old school battlefield, games but I am madly in love with the new due to is 64 player combat system, 32 players on each team trying to capture point and kill each other with regular ground combat or with vehicles.
					Battlefield constantly keeps my interest because of the class system and challenges they offer to get certain weapons or attachments. I also think its great because you can pick a server to play on or just randomly pick one. The one I mainly play is battlefield 4 but that might change
					 when battlefield 5 comes out which  takes place in World War II, some people say it is going to be a bad game because Call of Duty WW II just came out but I know Battlefield is TEN TIMES batter than.`;

					The reason I like Star Wars battlefront was because one was one was able to play different factions and different parts of time with the Star Wars timeline. 
					Star Wars Battlefront was first produced was to help promote the release of the star wars Trilogy DVD set.The game made bank and developed a series due to its popularity.
					When EA Games bought the right to reproduce a ,modernized version of Battlefront and battlefront 2, I was excited but worried at the same time. I was worried that they would just ruin the game
					over all but they didnt. When they released the game I was happy, they did the game some justice, they breathed life into the game. When they came out with battlefront 2 it was great because they incorporated
					a singleplayer story mode that is just great. I would say if your a shooter type of gamer and a Star Wars Fanboy I would say get it.`;

				document.getElementById("deadace").innerHTML= ` OK!! Dead Space is one of thoses games that you would never see. I remember people were scared to play Dead Space. You play as a guy named Isaac Clarke who is a systems engineer, that must fight  his way through a mining starship infested with am alien scourge. 
				The whole ships crew has been slaughtered and their corpes reanimated into creatures known as Necromorphs. 
				Various types of Necromorphs appear throughout the game, each with different abilities and requiring different tactics to defeat. 
				The game is played from an over-the-shoulder third-person perspective.Dead Space does not use a traditional heads-up display; instead, all information is relayed to the player via holographic projections from Isaac's Resource Integration Gear (RIG) spacesuit and the weapons themselves. example, a small holographic display is mounted on Isaac's 
				weapons to indicate ammunition count while aiming; also, the health meter is integrated into his suit spine and the spines of suits worn by other game characters.
				I loved the fact the combat involves dismemberment instead of just regular aiming and shooting. I this game you have to  shoot off the arms or shoot off the head for it to stop. Plus depending upon how you wounded the Necromorphs is, it can adopt a new stances and tactics. The game is crazy I love it.`;

			document.getElementById("Ghost").innerHTML=` Ghost Recon is dope, only because it kinda gave out a real time look at a being a covert soldier.
			I only go back as far as Jungle Storm which I thought was amazing because I at that time I was really thinking about joining the army when I was a kid.
			Then when I got done with that I instanly fell in love with the Advanced Warfighter series because that was just awesome, fighting using futuristic equipment and weapons.
			After that series I dont know what was going through their heads when they came out with all the other Ghost Recon games that were on the hand held devices.
			After their whole thing with the hand held devices game franchises, they came out with Ghost Recon Future Soldier which I thought was the best one that they ever came out with.
			I loved the fact that they had drones senors, OPTICAL CAMOUFLAGE!!! which I thought was dope. Then what was even better was the weapon customization it was amazing. I believe they should go back to this type of game than how 
			Wild Lands ended up, but they had to keep up the times I guess.`;
